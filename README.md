# Burger Application (Built With Sequelize)

* [View Project](https://burger2-rishabh.herokuapp.com/)

## Description
 REMAKE OF THE BURGER APP USING SEQUELIZE. This project is a full stack application that allows you to place an order for a burger. When you place an order, the burger you enter in the form field is added to the list of burgers on the left side of the screen. Each burger in the list has an "Eat This Burger" button. Clicking this button moves the burger from the list on the left side of the screen to the list on the right. The list on the right is a list of burgers that have already been eaten. Each burger in this list has a "I Want Another One" button that allows you to add another one of the same to the Burger's Left column.
